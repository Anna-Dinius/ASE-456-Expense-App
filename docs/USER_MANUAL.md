# 9. Tips & Best Practices

---

## Daily Habits for Success

**1. Log Expenses Immediately**

Don't wait until end of week. Record within a few hours while you remember.

✅ Do: Log at end of day  
❌ Don't: Wait until end of month

---

**2. Review Budget Weekly**

Check every Monday how you're tracking against your budget.

**Quick weekly review:**

1. Open app
2. Check **Budgets** tab (2 minutes)
3. Identify over-budget categories
4. Plan adjustments for coming week

---

**3. Categorize Correctly**

Use the right category for each transaction.

**For unclear transactions:**

- "Lunch at Target": Food & Dining (not Shopping)
- "Gas station snacks": Food & Dining (not Transportation)
- "Streaming service": Entertainment
- "Internet bill": Utilities

---

**4. Set Realistic Budgets**

Don't set budgets so low that you'll exceed them constantly.

**How to set budgets:**

1. Track spending for 1-2 months
2. See your actual averages
3. Set budgets based on these averages
4. Allow 10% buffer for flexibility
5. Adjust as you improve

---

## Money-Saving Tips

**1. Identify Spending Patterns**

Use charts to find where you overspend.

Example: "I spend too much on food. Let me pack lunch 3x/week."

**2. Set Category Goals**

Create ambitious but achievable targets:

- "Reduce entertainment from $400 to $250/month"
- "Food budget: max $350 (down from $450)"

**3. Track Recurring Expenses**

Look at your recurring transactions. Each one adds up:

- $15/month Netflix × 12 = $180/year
- $5 coffee × 22 work days = $110/month

---

**4. Use Budget Alerts**

Don't ignore yellow/red budget warnings. They're early warning signs.

**5. Review Quarterly**

Every 3 months:

- Review total spending trends
- Check goal progress
- Adjust budgets if needed
- Celebrate wins!

---

## Achieving Your Goals

**Goal-setting formula:**

**SMART Goals:**

- **S**pecific: "Save $2,500" (not "save money")
- **M**easurable: Specific dollar amount
- **A**chievable: Realistic for your income
- **R**elevant: Something you actually want
- **T**imed: By a specific date

**Example SMART Goal:**

❌ "Save more for vacation"  
✅ "Save $2,000 for Italy vacation by August 1"
