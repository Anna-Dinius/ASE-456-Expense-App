# Week 7: Budget UI Implementation
 
**Focus:** Budget creation & management UI, progress visualization, and integration.

---

# 🎯 Week 7 Overview

## What I Built This Week
- **Budget Creation UI** – `NewBudgetScreen` with validation, category picker, and period selection (Weekly, Monthly, Quarterly, Yearly, Custom dates)
- **Budget List & Management** – `BudgetsListScreen` with list, edit, and delete actions
- **Budget Editing** – `EditBudgetScreen` with pre-filled fields and active toggle
- **Progress Visualization** – Progress bars, status badges, utilization, remaining, and days left
- **App Integration** – Budgets icon in the app bar; navigation wired to categories and transactions

---
## Key Achievement
✅ Full CRUD budget workflow implemented with live progress calculations and UI polish

- **Features Completed:** 1 
- **Requirements Completed:** 2
- **Burndown Rate:** 33%

## File Highlights

# 🏗️ Architecture Evolution

## UI built on Week 6 services
- Reused `BudgetService` and `AnalyticsService` for data + calculations
- Followed patterns from Category and Savings Goal UIs
- Navigation & data flow consistent with existing architecture

---

# 📁 New/Updated Files (Week 7)

## New
- `lib/view/new_budget.dart`
- `lib/view/budgets_list.dart`
- `lib/view/edit_budget.dart`

## Updated
- `lib/model/budget.dart` – add `WEEKLY`, simplify `BudgetType`
- `lib/service/budget_service.dart` – inactive budget logic
- `lib/main.dart` – app bar navigation to Budgets

---

# 🧪 Quality & Behavior

## Active vs Inactive Budgets
- **Inactive**: Progress does not update; new transactions are ignored
- **Reactivate**: Progress recalculates instantly across the date range

## Visual Feedback
- Status badges (On Track, Getting Close, Almost Limit, Over Budget)
- Color-coded progress bars
